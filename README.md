## Requirements

To use the **Brochure Generator**, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.x**
- **requests**: To retrieve webpage content.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For parsing HTML and cleaning the website content.

- **IPython**: For displaying the summary in Markdown (optional, especially for Jupyter environments).

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 openai python-dotenv ipython
```

## Usage
Initialization
First, create a `.env` file and provide your OpenAI API credentials as shown below:

```env
OPENAI_API_AZURE_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your_endpoint_url_here
OPENAI_AZURE_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

## Generating a Brochure
To generate a brochure for a website, simply call the `BrochureGenerator.generate()` method with the company name and website URL:

```python
BrochureGenerator.generate("HuggingFace", "https://huggingface.co")
```

This will:

1. Scrape the website content.

2. Use OpenAI‚Äôs GPT model to generate a polished brochure.

3. Display the result in the specified format (Markdown).

## Customizing
You can customize the generated brochure by modifying the scraping and content formatting options in the code. For example, you can adjust the model or change the content structure as needed.

```python
BrochureGenerator.generate("My Company", "https://example.com")
```

## How it Works üîç
1. Website Scraping: The `Website` class extracts the title, text, and links from the provided URL. It filters out unnecessary links and keeps only the relevant ones (e.g., About, Careers).

2. Link Filtering: The system processes the extracted links, removing irrelevant ones like Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, etc., and identifies key links to be included in the brochure.

3. AI Brochure Creation: Using OpenAI‚Äôs GPT model, the `BrochureGenerator` class generates a professional brochure, making the information engaging and clear.

4. Display Summary: The brochure content is returned and displayed in an easy-to-read format (e.g., Markdown).

## Example Code

```python
BrochureGenerator.generate("HuggingFace", "https://huggingface.co")
```

This will automatically fetch the company information, generate a brochure, and display it in the Markdown format.
